# DSA

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository!

This project is a collection of implementations, notes, and resources pertaining to a wide variety of data structures and algorithms. It is designed to serve as a reference, a learning tool, or a code base for interviews and competitive programming practice.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Implementations of fundamental algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, etc.)
- Clean and well-documented code.
- Example problems and solutions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Infan-Jioun/DSA.git
   ```
2. **Explore the folders and files**  
   Each folder is typically dedicated to a specific topic or data structure.

3. **Run/Study the code**  
   The code is organized and commented for easy comprehension.
